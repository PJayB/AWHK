Usage
-----

In addition to the usual [Align Left], [Align Right], [Maximize], [Minimize] functionality that the Windows shortcuts provide, this application allows you to expand or contract the foreground window in the following ways:

- Expands the window's top edge to the top of your screen (Alt+Up),
- Rolls the window's BOTTOM edge up to half the height of the window (Alt+Up),
- Rolls the window's TOP edge down to half the height of the window (Alt+Down),
- Expands the window's left or right edges by 1/8th screen width (Alt+Left, Alt+Right),
- Contracts the window's left or right edges by 1/8th screen width (Alt+Left, Alt+Right)

Windows in the same column will react the same way. If you have two windows stacked on top of eachother, using Alt+Left will expand them both left, for example.

These are useful if you like using Win+Cursor, but wish you could:

- Make windows take up anything other than exactly half of your screen,
- Put two or more windows on each half, vertically.

Other keys:
- Alt+F1 loads this help page.
- Alt+F2 loads the configuration panel.

ToDo
----

- Add diagrams to this help for clarity
- Add quit hotkey (Alt+Esc maybe?)
- More consistency (doesn't work for some windows, e.g. Task Manager, Spotify)
- Auto-start-on-log-in functionality
- Fix the issue with previously pinned (Win+R/L) windows reverting to their old size
- Make windows snap to other windows, not just percentages of the screen size
- Key rebinding
