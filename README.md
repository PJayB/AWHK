AdvancedWindowHotkeys
=====================

Augments the functionality of the [Windows key + cursor keys] keyboard shortcuts.

Usage
-----

In addition to the usual [Align Left], [Align Right], [Maximize], [Minimize] functionality that the Windows shortcuts provide, this application allows you to expand or contract the foreground window in the following ways:

- Expands the window's top edge to the top of your screen (Alt+Up),
- Rolls the window's BOTTOM edge up to half the height of the window (Alt+Up),
- Rolls the window's TOP edge down to half the height of the window (Alt+Down),
- Expands the window's left or right edges by 1/8th screen width (Alt+Left, Alt+Right),
- Contracts the window's left or right edges by 1/8th screen width (Alt+Left, Alt+Right)

These are useful if you like using Win+Cursor, but wish you could:

- Make windows take up anything other than exactly half of your screen,
- Put two or more windows on each half, vertically.

ToDo
----

- Add help display hotkey (Alt+F1)
- Add quit hotkey (Alt+Esc maybe?)
- More consistency (doesn't work for some windows, e.g. Task Manager, Spotify)
