ToDo
-----------

- Load config from a file
- Invoke a proper config editor
- Monitor for config changes & reload when changed
- Installer/uninstaller
- More consistency (doesn't work for some windows, e.g. Spotify)
- Fix the issue with previously pinned (Win+R/L) windows reverting to their old size
- Defer repaint to improve performance?
